When you initialize a repository using git init,
terminal creates an empty git repository object in the
directory youâ€™re in. Then you can use git and save commits
to track different versions of your projects.

The staging area is a place sole for files that are
going into the next commit. It allows the programmer
to get their ducks in order before creating
a commit.
